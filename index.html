			<h2>事件經過</h2>
			<p>（在ropewiki上報告的兩個人）</p>
			<h3>最後一位垂降者（Willie Hunt）</h3>
			<p>這次Seven Teacups的行程有六名成員，其中有一位是第一次參加C級行程。我正在Corkscrew垂降點架設，用短的牛尾繩（tether）到上方固定點。為了不在瀑布上卡住，我讓每位成員游向我，我扣好牛尾繩（tether），確認每個部分都架設完好可供垂降、鎖好（lock 狀況良好，每個人皆順利開始垂降、順利開始垂降，從垂降站到越過瀑布邊緣<span class="translator-supplement">越過之後上方的人無法看到垂降者</span>，進入中等水量的瀑布中。</p>
			<p>除了一個人之外，其他成員都順利完成垂降：他在這個短距垂降上花了（糟糕地）很多時間。如果垂降停止，我已經準備好要釋放八字阻擋。<span class="translator-supplement"><a href="#contingency-anchor">推測的架設方式</a></span>。當系統架設好後，只有一點多餘的繩距——其實應該要調整為零的，但是已垂降的人中沒有人提示我要收回一些繩子。因為我在上方什麼都看不到，另外一名成員在下方觀察所有垂降者（觀察者），如果垂降者有問題，他可以用手臂示意我。期間我舉起手臂詢問一次，他回OK，然而我看得出來下方觀察者正專心地關注情況。我不認為這個垂降需要花超過一分鐘，然而他的情狀這令人擔心。<span class="original-content" title="This trip to Seven Teacups was a first time class C experience for one of the 6 party members. I was manning the Corkscrew rappel anchor on a short tether to the top bolt. I had each member swim to me positioned as to not get sucked over the waterfall, I attached a tether, made sure each got rigged for rappel properly and lock off (or high friction setting), brake hand rope around back and down at legs (everyone is right handed), I removed the tether, each swung around and rappelled. This work[ed] fine for everyone getting onto rappel without having issues getting disconnected from the station in the moderate-high water flow once over the waterfall lip. All members did fine rappelling except one, who spent an awful long time on this short rappel. I monitored the rope tension, and kept feeling it release significantly in spurts as the member made rappel progress. I was ready to release the contingency figure 8 block if I detected that progress had stopped. I did not want to lower him unless necessary because this would add extra rope in the pool and thus the swimming disconnect could become much harder with a tangled mess of extra rope. As the rope was set, there was only a few extra feet, which we should have reset to zero, but no one that went down signaled to me to raise the rope slightly. I had another member at the bottom watching each rappeler (spotter) and he could arm signal me if he saw an issue with the rappeler, since I could not see anything from the top. I raised my arms in question once, and he signaled OK, although I could tell my spotter was intently watching the situation. I don’t think this took much more than a minute, but it was concerning nevertheless."></span></p>
			<p>該名成員入水、脫出，游過Teacup第四池並爬上岩面（Rock Slab）與他人會合。我是最後一位垂降的人，我將回收端與Float Anchor拋出，而另外一個人抓住。我順利垂降，並且爬上大家短暫休息的slab。一切看起來都很好，但是其他人不OK：那位花了很多時間垂降的成員嚇壞了無法平復，這次他的第一次C級垂降。就算他確實是B級溪降者，水壓、在瀑布中呼吸、在充滿氣泡的水中游泳、冷水、和攀離水池的困難依然讓他猝不及防。他「關機」了，這「大大超越他的舒適圈」，他不講話。當我們結束休息並繼續移動時，他依然坐在那裡。開始移動時，就算是走下乾燥的rock slab都令他感到遲疑。我已經垂降下Teacup #6了，他才走到並滑到垂降點（無繩）。我看著其他人幫他垂直爬下slab，並且大量討論走下逃脫出口（escape exit）。我無法參與該決策（因為距離他們太遠、但是我在看），他和他的女朋友決定從簡易的逃出路線（escapte route）離開溪谷。其餘四人會繼續垂降，之後沒有其他問題發生。<span class="original-content" title="The member made the pool, disconnected, swam across teacup #4 and climbed up onto the rock slab with everyone else. I was the last person at risk. I tossed the pull side way out with a float. Another person grabbed it. I rapped without issue and climbed out on the slab where all 6 were taking a short break. All seemed to be good. But all was not OK, as the member that had taken so long to rappel was freaked out from being “in over his head” as his first class C experience. Even being a solid class B canyoneer did not prepare him for the water pounding, issues breathing in the waterfall, wet swimming disconnect in an aerated pool, the cold water, and difficult climb out of the pool. He was simply “shut down”, had “greatly exceeded his comfort zone”, and was not talking. When we finished the break and we started moving again he just sat there. Once moving he was excessively hesitant to even move down the dry rock slab. I was already all the way down at teacup #6, since it’s just walking and sliding down to that point (no rope work). I watched as others helped him verbally down the slab and there was extensive discussion once down to the escape exit. The decision was made without my involvement (since I was physically too far away, but watching) that he and his girlfriend would exit the canyon via the easy escape route. The remaining 4 decided that we would continue the Seven Teacups descent, and we had no further issues."></span></p>
			<p>回到人間（文明社會）後，發現可能是制動端的繩子纏在他的背包，使得垂降不順利。我無法確定他說的是否是對的，但是這的確會是問題。在強力的瀑布水流下，2-3個成員在水中後，接住拋下的大部分或是所有背包，通常會比較簡單和安全。這次垂降我並沒有提出這個建議，即使我們上次（唯一一次）在Seven Teacups有這樣做。如果他的繩子和背包真的纏在一起，這可以解釋他為什麼垂那麼慢。把背包丟下去可以解決這個問題，另外，對C級瀑布新手來說，人包分離對於解除狀況是非常有效的。<span class="original-content" title="There was also some indication after all members were back to civilization, that he may have had the brake hand side rope tangled in his backpack, and this would have caused slow progress on rappel. I could not confirm this, but this does bring up an issue. In strong waterfall force, it is often easier and safer to toss most or all the packs down drops after 2 or 3 members are in the pool below to retrieve them. I did not think about suggesting this for this drop, even though this is how we did this on my only previous trip to Seven Teacups. If in fact he did have rope backpack entanglement, that would explain much about his slow rappel progress. Tossing packs down would have solved that problem. Also for those new to class C waterfalls, removing the backpack from the equation is extremely helpful.”"></span></p>
			<h3>行程組織者／當事人的女朋友（Kelly Morr）</h3>
			<p>這次我最主要學到，團隊應該要確認如何溝通。我們的團隊沒有明確的領隊——我組織了行程、Willie有最豐富的激流（swiftwater）經驗、而Joe來過Teacup最多次。然而我不認為誰真的承擔領隊的角色。我列印並分享了在夾鏈袋中的紙本路線（beta）給所有成員（與原始的陳述不同），但是覺得其他人看起來有看，因此行程中並沒有積極地參考路線資料。Joe為跳水點和anchor在哪裡提供建議，但是，沒有人在任何時間集合團隊並確認我們都了解溝通的信號、或是確認所有人都了解要面臨的特殊關卡。<span class="original-content" title="I think the biggest thing I will take away from this is to make sure the group knows how to communicate. Our party had no clear leader — I organized the trip, the last person at risk had more swiftwater experience, and “Canyoneer J” had run Teacups most recently. However I don’t think any of us truly embodied a leader. I had printed and distributed paper beta in ziplock bags to all members (contrary to what was stated in the original post) but wasn’t actively referring to it during the trip, as others seemed to have “taken charge.” Canyoneer J was giving advice on where we could jump/where anchors were."></span></p>
			<p>但是，沒有人在任何時間集合團隊並確認我們都了解溝通的信號、或是確認所有人都了解要面臨的特殊關卡。（準確來說，並非一直如此。第一跳時溝通非常順暢，但在corkscrew垂降時不然。）<span class="original-content" title="However at no point did any of us gather the group and make sure we were clear on signals, or make sure everyone understood what unique challenges we’d face. (Rather, this was inconsistent; info was communicated really well on the first jump, but not so much on the corkscrew rap)."></span></p>
			<p>我不認為任何人會抱怨這件事——我們是網路糾團的蝦兵蟹將、我不認為我們三人之中誰真的選錯了路線、我不認為任何人不負責任、我也不認為任何人在技術層次「遇到麻煩」。（有些人沒有嘗試過C級垂降路線，對，但是意外的成因與技術關係不大這次事件可以用較順暢的溝通快速改善。）。<span class="original-content" title="I don’t think anyone is to blame for this — we were a ragtag group assembled from the internet. I don’t think there was anything fundamentally wrong with the beta. I don’t think any individual failed in a responsibility. I don’t even think anyone was “in over their head” in terms of skill level. (Some of us were new to class C, sure, but what caused the incident had little to do with skill. And could have been much more quickly remedied with better communication.)"></span></p>
			<p>我學到的是：雖然我不是最有經驗的人，但我可以（且應該）站出來擔任領導者，以確保我們都了解彼此、並瞭解如何一同解決問題。另外，如果我不了解團隊中的其他成員，我應該事前加倍確認自己看過路線資料、並自我訓練溪降技能。<span class="original-content" title="What I’ve learned from this is that even if I’m not the most technically experienced, I can and should still step into a leadership role and ensure that we all understand each other and know how to work together to solve problems. And if I don’t know the other people in my group well, I should make doubly sure I’m educating myself by reading beta and practicing techniques before I leave."></span></p>
			<p>我和我男朋友針對這次事件討論了很多，我可以拼湊起來的是，他卡住了且無法繼續垂降，在此水流很強。這可能是因為繩子卡在他的背和背包之間，但是我們不確定。當他要垂降時我看到繩子在那裡，我試圖引起男朋友和Willie（在垂降站的成員）的注意但是失敗了。我並沒有意識到這將是艱難的垂降，而我其實可以在男朋友要垂降時就簡單地修正錯誤。我的錯誤在於沒有看過路線資料，且沒有認真看待我所看過的資料。垂降時卡住讓垂降者向前翻動，在水壓下，他幾乎不可能改善狀況；沒有緊握潮濕的岩石可能讓事情變得更糟。他向下方成員揮手，企圖示意他們他所遇到的麻煩，但是他們沒看到、或是不了解他想說什麼。而我還在上方，什麼都看不見。<span class="original-content" title="Having talked to my boyfriend a lot about this, what I can piece together is he got stuck and was unable to continue lowering himself, right on the part of the rap where the water flow is the strongest. This may have been caused by a rope caught between his back and his pack, but it’s unclear. I saw it there as he was getting on rap and tried to get my boyfriend & the last person at risk’s attention but didn’t; I didn’t realize this was such a tough rap and figured my boyfriend could easily correct once on rap. My fault for not reading the beta and not making a bigger deal of what I saw. Getting stuck caused [the rappelier] to get flipped forward, and with the pressure of the water, it was almost physically impossible for him to right himself which possibly made things worse by having shoes that were not gripping the wet rock at all. He waved to those already down to try to signal his distress, but they either didn’t see or didn’t understand what he was trying to say. I was still at the top and could not see anything.”"></span></p>

		<h2>ICAD分析</h2>
		<p>順暢的溝通很重要，團隊應該要在行程開始前就建立通用的信號與溝通管道。適切的突發事件應對方案、對於技術層次的意識、和團隊互動是人和行程前的重要考量；同時還有其他常見的因素像是天氣和環境。個體的技術熟練程度有時很難判斷，就算一個人有很多C級溪谷經驗，可以問一些重要的問題幫助判斷團隊是否互動良好。舉例來說，溪降團隊的角色（領隊、領隊助手、架設手、繩袋手、安全官、確保手和背工）、他們是否陷入危機、他們曾與誰一同溪降（可以做為參考來源）、和技術問題或假設性難題可幫助闡釋一個人的經驗等級。<span class="original-content" title="Good communication is important; groups should establish common signals and communications at the beginning of the trip and the canyon. Proper contingency planning and awareness of skill levels and team dynamics are an important consideration before any trip, as are other traditional factors such as weather, conditions, etc. Individual skill level can be difficult to determine. Even if a person is “experienced” with Class C canyons, important questions can be asked to help determine whether a group will have good dynamics. For example, the roles people played during their canyon trips (trip leader, assistant, rigger, bagger, safety, belayer, pack mule, etc), whether they have been in emergency situations in canyons, who they have canyoned with (those people can serve as references), and technical questions or hypothetical problems can help elucidate an individuals’ level of experience."></span></p>
		<p>有經驗的溪降者不見得有良好的團隊互動能力，且可能讓互動變得更加困難：因為老鳥可能自己先把事情做完而不留意其他團隊成員、或是因為其經驗而態度傲慢。就算是很有經驗的團隊，每次都應該要規劃緊急與突發事件應對方案。<span class="original-content" title="Experienced canyoneers may not necessarily have good group and team dynamics, and can make situations more difficult by going ahead of everyone, not looking out for other team members, or having a cavalier attitude because of their experience. Due caution and contingency planning should always be done, even if the team is highly experienced."></span></p>
		<p>困難或是危險的垂降時，人包分離是非常有幫助的。此外，有經驗的峽谷探險者和（或）垂降系統架設人員應該支援垂降者和團隊成員，隨時傳遞資訊並監控狀況m。告知所有垂降者抵達anchor和垂降時的難關、以及發生緊急事件時該做什麼是可取的行為。<span class="original-content" title="At difficult or dangerous rappels, removing packs is incredibly helpful. In addition, those experienced with the canyon and/or the rigger for that drop should be constantly communicating information and monitoring the situation, from both rappelers and the team members behind. It is advisable to inform each rappeler about the hazards of approaching the anchor, the hazards of the rappel, and how to behave in the event of an emergency."></span></p>
